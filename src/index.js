   Phase B: health plus read-only routes. The frontend still runs
   entirely on localStorage and calls none of this.

   D1. Every database operation goes through a Worker route, which

/**
 * Every collection exposes the same two shapes: a list at
 * /api/<name> and a detail at /api/<name>/<id>. Registering them
 * here keeps the path parsing in one place — adding a collection is
 * one line plus its route module, not another branch in the router.
 *
 * `create`/`update`/`remove` are optional. A collection that has them
 * accepts POST on its list path and PUT/DELETE on its detail path; one
 * that does not answers 405 there, with an Allow header naming only what
 * it really takes. The six simple entities have writes as of C-2,
 * appointments as of C-3, job cards as of C-5, invoices as of C-7 and
 * payments as of C-8. Every collection the app writes now has a write
 * path; settings is the one that does not, and C-9 owns it.
 *
 * `actions` is the one exception to "a collection is a list and a detail":
 * a named POST under a record, for a business operation that is not a
 * field change. C-6 added the first, because a job card's status is a
 * transition with its own rules, its own inventory effects and its own
 * appointment sync; C-7 added voiding an invoice, which cancels a
 * document while releasing its payments as advances; C-8 added voiding
 * and linking a payment, each of which moves an invoice's balance. All
 * are refused through PUT deliberately, so no rule has two homes.
