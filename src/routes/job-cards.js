/* ============================================================
   routes/job-cards.js — GET /api/job-cards[/:id]   (read-only)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   The central workshop transaction record, and the first
   collection with child line tables, so it does not go through
   lib/collection.js.

   Why bespoke rather than the shared factory: collectionRoutes()
   builds one fixed SQL string, maps one row at a time, and issues
   exactly two queries. A job card needs its service and part lines
   too, which means an IN-list whose placeholder count varies, a
   mapper that takes a row plus two line sets, and three to six
   queries. Teaching the factory all of that would turn it into the
   generic CRUD layer lib/collection.js:11-14 deliberately refuses
   to be, and would complicate six collections to serve one. So the
   plumbing is written out here instead, reusing lib/http.js for
   the response envelope, the id and parameter validators, and
   every status code, so the contract is identical to the other
   collections.

   ---- what this route must never do ----

   1. paid and due are HISTORICAL SNAPSHOTS, frozen when the job
      card was invoiced. They are NOT the live payment balance.
      The live balance lives in Utils.liveJobBalance() on the
      client, which reads the invoice when one exists and is not
      Void (utils.js:163-175), and that is the fix for audit
      Finding 1. This route reports the stored numbers and joins
      neither invoices nor payments. Computing a live balance here
      would put Finding 1's answer in two places, which is exactly
      how the original bug got in.

   2. Service and part lines are SNAPSHOTS. js/job-cards.js:16-18
      states it: "name + unitPrice are SNAPSHOTS; catalog changes
      never rewrite history." A job card that sold "Premium Oil
      Change" at 1200 still says so after the catalogue renames the
      service and reprices it. So the catalogue is never joined,
      and nothing is refreshed from services or parts.

   3. Nothing is derived. Totals are recomputed by the client
      before every save (computeTotals(), job-cards.js:95) and
      stored; this route returns what is stored. Inventory is not
      touched at all: no stock recalculation, no issued quantity,
      no SUM over inventory_transactions. parts.stock stays the one
      answer to "how much is in stock", as established in B-6.

   4. Relationships stay as ids. Five of them -- customer, vehicle
      and mechanic are NOT NULL, appointment and invoice nullable
      -- and none is embedded. The UI resolves names at render time
      from the ids it already holds.

/* ============================================================
   C-5 — the write half
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   POST /api/job-cards, PUT /api/job-cards/:id, DELETE
   /api/job-cards/:id, plus the inventory reconciliation an edit
   performs.

   Everything below is a port of what js/job-cards.js and
   js/utils.js already do, moved server-side. Where a rule looks
   surprising, the line number of the client code it preserves is
   given. Nothing here is a new business rule.

   ---- the five things this route must get right ----

   1. TOTALS ARE NEVER TRUSTED. job-cards.js:21-22 -- "All totals
      are recalculated in JS before saving -- client totals are
      never trusted." computeTotals() below is a line-for-line port
      of job-cards.js:95-109, and subtotal/tax/total/due are
      refused by name if a caller sends them.

   2. LINES ARE SNAPSHOTS. name, partNo and unitPrice are stored as
      given and never refreshed from the catalogue. That is why a
      line carries its own name even when it has a serviceId.

   3. INVENTORY IS RECONCILED, NOT RE-APPLIED. The ledger -- not
      the job card's own lines -- says how much a job has actually
      been issued (utils.js:254-261). An edit moves only the
      difference. See reconcile() below.

   4. ONE BATCH. The job card, its two line tables, every stock
      movement, every ledger row and the appointment back-link go
      in a single env.DB.batch(), so a shortage on the third part
      undoes the first two and the job card with them.

   5. STATUS IS NOT TOUCHED HERE. The client changes status through
      changeStatus() (job-cards.js:967), a separate operation with
      its own transitions, its own inventory effects and its own
      appointment sync. C-6 owns it. A write here that tried to
      move the status would be a second, competing state machine,
      so status is immutable on PUT and fixed to 'Received' on
      POST -- exactly what openCreateModal() (:877) stores.
   ============================================================ */

/* ---- the status model, copied from job-cards.js:32-56 ------------------- */

// Every status the column's CHECK allows, in the client's own order.
const STATUSES = [
  'Received', 'Inspection', 'Waiting for Approval', 'In Progress',
  'Waiting for Parts', 'Completed', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled',
];
// :877 — openCreateModal() stores this and nothing else.
const CREATE_STATUS = 'Received';
// :39 — the edit form refuses to open at all on one of these.
const TERMINAL = ['Completed', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled'];
// utils.js:114 — DONE_JOB_STATUSES, the second delete blocker.
const DONE = ['Completed', 'Delivered'];
// :1062 — the third delete blocker: everything else is "work has started".
const DELETABLE = ['Received', 'Cancelled'];
// :45 — the only statuses where an edit has to reconcile stock, because they
// are the only ones where stock has already moved for this job.
const INVENTORY_TRACKED = ['In Progress', 'Waiting for Parts'];

const PRIORITIES = ['low', 'normal', 'high', 'urgent'];
// :67 — plus '', which the column's CHECK also allows for "not recorded".
const FUEL_LEVELS = ['', 'empty', 'quarter', 'half', 'three-quarter', 'full'];
// :70 — the five states an inspection row can be in.

// verbatim so a ledger row written here is indistinguishable from one the
// browser wrote.
const adjustNote = (jobId) => `Adjusted on ${jobId} (qty change)`;

/* ============================================================
   C-6 — the status transition
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   POST /api/job-cards/:id/status, and the ONLY place a job card's
   status moves. C-5's PUT refuses a status change on purpose, so
   there is exactly one state machine in this API and it is the one
   below.

   This is a port of changeStatus() (job-cards.js:964-1036). One
   request can move the job card's status, its completedAt or
   actualDelivery, parts.stock, the inventory ledger and the linked
   appointment's status. All of it goes in ONE env.DB.batch().

   ---- the four things that make this safe ----

   1. THE STATUS UPDATE IS THE GATE. It carries
      `AND status = <expected>`, so two concurrent requests cannot
      both perform the same transition -- one matches the row, the
      other matches nothing. meta.changes says which happened.

   2. EVERY DEPENDENT STATEMENT IS CONDITIONAL ON THAT GATE.
      Statements in a batch share one transaction, so the ones
      after it re-read the job card's status and do nothing unless
      the transition actually landed. A status update that changes
      no rows can therefore never be followed by a stock movement.

   3. THE DEDUCTION CARRIES hasJobDeduction() ITSELF. The ledger
      INSERT's `NOT EXISTS (... job-card-use ... this job ... this
      part)` is utils.js:241-245 written in SQL -- the same rule
      that makes In Progress <-> Waiting for Parts ping-pong safe
      in the browser. The stock UPDATE beside it applies only if
      that INSERT wrote its row, so the two can never disagree.

   4. A RETURN RE-VERIFIES THE BALANCE IT PLANNED AGAINST, and
      yields a NULL quantity if it moved -- which the column's NOT
      NULL turns into a rolled-back batch rather than a wrong
      return. The status change goes back with it.
   ============================================================ */

/**
 * The transition table, copied from job-cards.js:46-56.

 * This is the whole state machine and nothing is derived from it: a status is
