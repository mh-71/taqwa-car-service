   routes/session.js — signing in and out
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Three routes, and they are the only ones besides /api/health
   that an unauthenticated caller may reach. They have to be:
   a browser with no credential cannot ask for one through a
   gate that requires one.

     POST   /api/session   { passphrase }  -> 204 + Set-Cookie
                           { username, password }  (a staff member's account)
     DELETE /api/session                   -> 204 + cleared cookie
     GET    /api/session                   -> { authenticated, passphrase, accounts, account? }

   Being public is exactly why each is written to give nothing
   away. The POST answers a wrong passphrase with the same 401
   the rest of the API uses, after a constant-time comparison,
   and never says whether a passphrase is configured at all.
   The GET reports a boolean -- and, for an account session only,
   that account's own id, username and role, so the app can say who
   is signed in. A passphrase session has no who. A wrong username
   and a wrong password are one and the same 401.
