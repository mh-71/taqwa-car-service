/* ============================================================
   changes.js — the change log devices pull from (0020)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   After a write route answers 2xx, the router records what
   changed: the record itself ('upsert', or 'delete' -- a
   tombstone), and a 'refresh' for each collection the same
   write may also have moved (a payment moves its invoice's
   balance; a job card's status moves stock). A device pulls
   these by a server sequence number (GET /api/sync/pull).

   Written here, after the write, and NOT by triggers: D1 counts
   rows a trigger writes in the statement's meta.changes, and
   the write guards in the routes depend on that count.

   A failure to log never fails the write that already happened:
   it is reported in the Worker log, and a device then simply
   catches up at its next full online load.
