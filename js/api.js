   api.js — the one place the browser talks to the Worker API
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   storage.js calls this; UI modules never do. Everything about
   HTTP lives here: where the API is, how a request is
   authenticated, and how a failure becomes something the UI can
   show.

   ---- where the API is ----

   One base URL, resolved once, in this order:

     1. window.TAQWA_API_BASE            (explicit override)
     2. <meta name="taqwa-api-base">     (per-deployment, no JS)
     3. same origin + /api               (the normal case)
     4. null on file:// -- a page opened from disk has no origin
        to call, so the app stays on localStorage rather than
        firing requests that cannot succeed.

   Same origin is the default on purpose: it needs no CORS on the
   Worker and no origin allow-list to keep in step. `npm run
   dev:app` serves this folder and proxies /api to `wrangler dev`
   for exactly that reason.

   ---- authentication ----

   Every route except /api/health and /api/session now requires a
   credential, READS INCLUDED, and there are two kinds.

   A browser signs in at /api/session with the workshop passphrase
   and is given an HttpOnly cookie. Nothing in this file can read
   that cookie, store it, or leak it -- the browser attaches it
   and script never sees it. That is the whole point of doing it
   this way rather than with a token.

   A machine (CI, the integration suite) uses
   `Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>` instead, supplied at runtime
   through Api.configure({ token }) and held in a closure for that
   page's lifetime only. Nothing here ships a token, reads one from
   the repository, or puts one in localStorage or sessionStorage.

   A request with no credential is SENT and refused by the server
   with a 401, rather than second-guessed here: the cookie is
   invisible to this code, so the server is the only thing that
   knows whether a request can be authenticated.

   This requires the app and the API to share an origin -- which
   they do, by being served from the same Worker. Cookies are why:
   a cross-origin deployment would need CORS with credentials, and
   a browser will not attach a cookie to a preflight at all.
